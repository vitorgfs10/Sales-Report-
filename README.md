An analysis of sales data from a U.S.-based e-commerce platform was conducted for the period between January 2023 and June 2023. The analysis considered only processed and delivered sales, excluding cancellations before or after delivery. Additionally, a page for transaction and cashback credit inquiries was developed based on customer ID, email, or name.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Reports:
 

The following are the main KPIs and reports that needed to be constructed:

 

Quantity and value of orders sold and delivered.

Average delivery time.

Repurchase rate during the same period.

Number of distinct customers who placed orders.

Distribution of product categories.

Types of payment.

Sales by state.

Hands On
A dedicated database was created exclusively for this purpose, using fake data available on Kaggle. Data cleaning involved uploading the datasets to Google Big Query with specific schemas for orders, categories, users, and cashback.
